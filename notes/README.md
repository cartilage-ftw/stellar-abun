# Notes
Apart from notes for other things I already mentioned (see the contents of this folder),
I was reading articles in the summer and taking notes of them (digitally). I thought this would be a good place to put them.
I ended up writing only [Frebel (2018) _Ann. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sci._](Frebel2018.md) in here (and that too, incomplete).

Later, upon a friend's suggestion, I started using _Notion_. On [this notion page](https://level-tracker-b9e.notion.site/Article-Notes-d302ddd54d9d4016b86c22f25482513e), I put notes for

* [Fenner (2006)](https://level-tracker-b9e.notion.site/Fenner-2006-GCE-cc390437fa81492f89fbb9301a4548d4) simple, accessible review article on GCE. She particularly also included concrete examples of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy iirc
* [Simon (2019) _Ann. Rev. Astron. Astrophs._](https://level-tracker-b9e.notion.site/Simon-2019-The-Faintest-Dwarf-Galaxies-10e5ea95e9b54285a22103be875c0e68) -- I think I took remaining notes on OneNote.

and then I started writing on OneNote... I wrote on a couple of articles (see for yourself [here, in this notebook](https://lpuin-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/aayush_11912610_lpu_in/ErEAFPX-MwBOstZcwFTR8VsBtF61NPuf-MpnGYd3s0tU1w?rtime=m4dR_Zzi2Ug))
.. and then I don't know if I wrote anything anymore. But if you'd like access to my `TO-READ` list, hit me up anytime. Might share it on my website, maybe.
