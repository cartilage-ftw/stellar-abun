# Article Notes
I was reading articles in the summer and taking notes of them (digitally). I thought this would be a good place to put them.
I ended up writing only [Frebel (2018) _Ann. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sci._](Frebel2018.md) in here (and that too, incomplete).

Later, upon a friend's suggestion, I started using _Notion_. On [this notion page](https://www.notion.so/Article-Notes-d302ddd54d9d4016b86c22f25482513e), I put notes for
* [Simon (2019) _Ann. Rev. Astron. Astrophs._](https://www.notion.so/Fenner-2006-GCE-cc390437fa81492f89fbb9301a4548d4) -- I think I took remaining notes on OneNote.
* [Fenner (2006)](https://www.notion.so/Simon-2019-The-Faintest-Dwarf-Galaxies-10e5ea95e9b54285a22103be875c0e68) simple, accessible review article on GCE. She particularly also included concrete examples of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy iirc

and then I started writing on OneNote...
.. and then I don't know if I wrote anything anymore. But if you'd like access to my `TO-READ` list, hit me up anytime. Might share it on my website, maybe.
