## Neutron capture processes
Elements upto Z $\leq$ 30 (including Zinc, excluding H, He) are synthesized in stars and stellar explosions (i.e. SNe) by fusion processes. Elements heavier than these are produced by neutron-capture processes -- which require seed nuclei (e.g. Fe) and a certain amount of neutron flux.

* **r-process**
	* neutron capture is faster (more "rapid") than corresponding beta-decay half life of unstable isotopes produced along the way. 
	* when the decay back to stability finally happens, we end up with neutron-rich heavy elements
	* half of elements heavier than zinc are synthesized this way.
* the postulated intermediate (i-)process is similar to s- but requires signficantly higher neutron densities.

### Astrophysical signature of s-process
* Requires high neutron density (**Note**: though, not among the highest densities for neutron-capture processes, see that for r-process below). One environment for this is then AGB stars.
#### main s-process
* In 1-3 solar mass stars $^{13}C(\alpha, n) ^{16}O$ is the dominant source of neutrons leading to $n_n$ ~ $10^8$ neutrons $cm^{-3}$.
	* That itself requires production of $^{13}C$ from $^{12}C$ by partial completion of the CNO cycle, which itself requires that sufficient protons are available in the helium intershell of the AGB star.
**Note**: details of  existence and operation of $^{13}C$ pocket activation and proton mixing episodes remain under debate (ref. Herwig 2005, ARAA).
* During convective thermal pulses, the s-process elements produced are dredged up to the surface and ejected as part of the strong stellar winds AGB stars have.
* Operates on timescales of 1,000 to 10,000 years.
	* **Question**: are these the timescales of the thermal pulses or something to do with the time it takes for these reactions to complete.
* Since there are more of 1-3 solar mass stars than more massive ones, this process contributes significantly to the overall heavy element content of the universe.

The abundance pattern for the s-process has three peaks -- one is around Z ~ 38-40, second is at 56-60, and third peak is around Z ~ 82-83. The peaks arise near these numbers due to extra stability at magic number of protons.

* The 'main' s-process produces elements with Z $\geq$ 40, i.e. includes the second and third peaks.

#### weak s-process
* dominates in stars with mass 3-8 solar masses
* $n_n$ ~ $10^{10} cm^{-3}$ (notice this is greater than that for main s-process)
* From the $^{14}N$ built up from the CNO cycle, Ne and then Mg are formed by a chain of reactions $^{14}N(\alpha, \gamma)^{18}F(e^{+} + \nu) ^{18}O(\alpha, \gamma)^{22}Ne$, followed by $^{22}Ne(\alpha, n)^{25}Mg$
